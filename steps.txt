1.   Train a classifier on the training set, and then use that classifier as the backbone for the siamese network.
2.   Train a verifier (siamese network), using the classifier backbone as a pre-trained network.
3.   Afterwards, perform verification and store the results for each image pair.
4.   Finally, use an analysis script to obtain the final results.
